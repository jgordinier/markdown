Daisy Good Neighbor

Trefoil Trunk September

# Badge Overview

Groups of people are called communities. You&#39;re part of lots of communities! Your Daisy troop is a community, and so is your class at school. You can help your communities by being a good neighbor. Find out how in this badge.

# Activity 1

## Show how you&#39;re a good neighbor

A good neighbor is a person who does her best to be helpful and take care of the people and places around her. When you follow the Girl Scout Promise and Law, you&#39;re not only a good neighbor, you&#39;re also a good citizen! On the next page, draw a picture of yourself. In the circles around your picture, write or draw the different ways you&#39;re a good citizen at school. Maybe you invite new girls to play with you on the playground or help keep your classroom clean. That&#39;s being a good citizenband a good neighbor!

# Activity 2

## Build your town

Does your town have schools, a fire station, a library, and a Town Hall? Can you think of other places? How do you think the people in each place act like good neighbors to one another? Use the sticker sheet that came in this month&#39;s Trefoil Trunk to make a model of places in your town. You can decorate with markers, stickers, paint, or paper.

# Activity 3

Learn about a good neighbor from your state. With the help of an adult, pick out a book or go online to read about someone you think was a good neighbor from your state. If you can&#39;t read yet, that&#39;s ok! Have an adult read to you. If you&#39;re from Alabama, check out TrailBlazer TV to see GSNCA&#39;s amazing series on the women who shaped Alabama!
